# Hijack Website

## A new website to update the styling and functionality of anisonhijack.moe
### Early Goals:
- Replicate original website's functionality
- Demonstrate understanding on hosting and updating processes
### Later Goals:
- New styling
- Integration with other Anison Hijack tools

## Developing

Install dependancies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), and start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Formatting

Use `npm run lint` to check for errors, and `npm run format` for auto-format with prettier.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
